Think deeply about this and take all the time you need. 

## Task

I'll give you here the minutes of multiple meetings, multiple files about stack, multiple LLM findings, and multiple Slack conversations, along with information about the backend architecture and stack in this INEXER project, and I want you to write a singe file (truth.md), which contains the 'truth'. The truth is the engineering facts, including:
- key architecture decisions6
- key challenges and weak points
- key TODO if any 
- key security threat if any 
- key features that are offered by the indexer as part of the WDK
- key features that need to be in the WDK to be top industry standard 
- key features that can be as good add ups
- any other notes or concerns or suggestions that can help from engineering/product perspectives.

Things to read: 
- Meeting minutes files in ./_minutes
- Read the files ./_docs/APP_RELATIONS.md, ./_docs/setup.txt, ./_docs/WARP.md
- Understand the diagram ./_docs/wdk-indexer-local-diagram.mmd which doesn't include everything
- The tickets in ./_docs/_tickets (check files, folders, and subfolders)

## Important: 
1- Be concise. Don't over elaborate on any part. 
2- Put all the output and findings in _docs/_TRUTH_OUT.md in a well formatted way. 
3- This task will repeat every month or so, so make sure the output is expandable/changeable.

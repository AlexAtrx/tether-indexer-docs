## Context

- This is about this particular ticket: \_docs/tasks/14-jan-26-Rumble-investigate-missing-live-chat-notification/ticket.md
- First off, you need to read the context around the context of this issue that were written a few days ago:
  \_docs/tasks/12-jan-2026-new-notifs-issue
- Pay special attention to the discussion of the Tee and Poole Slack:
  \_docs/tasks/12-jan-2026-new-notifs-issue/slack-discussion.txt
- Let me continue understanding the rest of Slack:
  \_docs/tasks/14-jan-26-Rumble-investigate-missing-live-chat-notification/slack-more.md
- As you can see, the later discussion ended with sharing logs.

## Task

Since we have already initial set of findings that we have shared with the team, which you can find in Slack, shared by Alex, we need to dig deeper into the logs and understand what is going on.

### What to do

1. Read the logs and try to understand what is going on.
2. Try to find the root cause of the issue.
3. Share your findings with me here in a new file in \_docs/tasks/14-jan-26-Rumble-investigate-missing-live-chat-notification

### Notes

- Think long and deep and take your time.

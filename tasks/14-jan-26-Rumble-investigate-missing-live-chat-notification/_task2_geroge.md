## George's response:

My understanding is that the primary cause we're investigating right now is no webhook when dt + id is present, but payload is absent.
production requests that do not include the required identifiers (dt and id) or a payload
Do we mean the requests sent to addresses directly (not triggered by QR) ? If yes, this is expected, it's an improvement which Rumble requested.

Answer him based on the findings.md file and your understanding of the issue.

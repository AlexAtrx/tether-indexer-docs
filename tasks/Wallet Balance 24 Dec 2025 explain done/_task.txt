Explain to me what's done in this subject as a whole (I'm pointing to the PR and their reviews, but explain what's done in these PRs).

Add to the explanation a string paragraph that tells what's done without pointing to modules. But add to it the repo names indicating what's done in what repo. 

In the rest of the explanation, mentioned repos, modules and tech approach.

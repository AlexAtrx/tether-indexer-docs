Title:
Fix ork discovery empty-list failure after restart (Jan 5 prod issue) - handle ERR_TOPIC_LOOKUP_EMPTY

Description:

Background
After a full system restart, new wallet creation failed for ~4.5 hours because the app attempted ork RPC calls before any ork workers were discoverable. The request went through with an undefined ork RPC key, causing a generic internal error instead of a controlled "service unavailable" response.

Scope
- Guard ork RPC selection when the ork list is empty and return a clear 503-style error.
- Handle ERR_TOPIC_LOOKUP_EMPTY during ork discovery/refresh: log/metric on empty and avoid overwriting with an empty list.
- Add a readiness gate so the HTTP server does not accept traffic until at least one ork is discoverable, or fail fast with a clear startup error on timeout.
- Fix RoundRobin update behavior to avoid NaN/invalid index on empty lists (wdk-app-node and wdk-ork-wrk).
- Add a small regression test for /api/v1/connect behavior when ork list is empty.

Validation / Investigation
- Check ork worker logs for the 4.5 hour window to confirm all ork requests were failing or not arriving.
- Confirm app-node logs show ERR_TOPIC_LOOKUP_EMPTY during that window.
- Reproduce locally: run app-node without ork workers; verify it fails startup with ERR_TOPIC_LOOKUP_EMPTY, and if startup is allowed, /connect returns a controlled 503.

Acceptance Criteria
- New wallet creation and ork-dependent endpoints return a clear, controlled error when no orks are available (not a generic 500).
- ERR_TOPIC_LOOKUP_EMPTY during startup/refresh is handled explicitly and logged.
- RoundRobin selection does not become invalid after empty updates.
- Readiness gate prevents accepting traffic until at least one ork is discoverable (or fails fast with a clear error on timeout).
- A test covers the empty ork list scenario.

Notes
- Keep behavior safe for Autobase deployments; Mongo deployments should not regress.

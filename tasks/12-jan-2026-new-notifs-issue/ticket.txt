Title:

Rumble: Investigate on George's reported missing live chat notification

Description:

more context was given by George on 12th of Jan's call


The core of the issue is that when the mobile app is sending us a request like this
POST https://wallet-9p1aan4nff.rmbl.ws/api/v1/notifications

{
  "type": "TOKEN_TRANSFER",
  "to": "4e5d9878-28b2-4932-a7a7-e1d0efcb5839",
  "from": "63d93b4d-cc6e-4ee8-b2f3-c73f38e01b74",
  "blockchain": "arbitrum",
  "token": "usdt",
  "amount": "0.11",
  "transactionReceiptId": "0x1a4bb63c058fdb47d0317201c4585fc53177844e60b8b89ec072123857004b4c",
  "dt": "u",
  "id": "4r9UJ-g3XEs"
}
as a result of the QR code scan and transaction after that

we don't send Rumble any webhook (or anyway if we send the flow is broken and they can't pop up the live chat notification for the user).

We need to investigate on this issue and have a short meeting or a disussion in slack when the root cause has been identified - before proceeding with the fix.

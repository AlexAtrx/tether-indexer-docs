## Context

### History to read

* These 2 folders are about a wallet balance issue: 
_docs/tasks/Wallet Balance Oscillation After Transactions
_docs/tasks/Wallet Balance task balance flickers

### Slack message is shared with the team:

"
* TL;DR:
Balances can flip because each request may hit different upstream providers/peers that aren’t at the same block height. When cached and live requests mix, you see alternating “old vs new” values until the upstream sources converge.

* The fix impacts all of:
wdk-indexer-wrk-base
wdk-indexer-wrk-evm
wdk-indexer-wrk-btc
wdk-indexer-wrk-solana
wdk-indexer-wrk-ton
wdk-indexer-wrk-tron

* Just sharing before the PRs.

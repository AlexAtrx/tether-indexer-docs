Vigan:
maybe we should reduce syncWalletTransfersJob intervals? I think we still do them every 5s even though we have event driven approach in rumble prod now

Francecso:
yes
there's this and another 2-3 events that spam a lot of events
I will provide a full list
but this one for sure we need to reduce
we're hammering the DB

Viagn:
yeah is unnecessarily consuming resources

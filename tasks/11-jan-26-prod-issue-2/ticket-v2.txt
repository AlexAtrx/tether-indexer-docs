Title:
Fix ork discovery empty-list failure after restart (Jan 5 Prod issue)

Description:

Background
After a full system restart, new wallet creation failed for ~4.5 hours because the app attempted ork RPC calls before any ork workers were available. This produced a generic internal error instead of a controlled "service unavailable" response. A related RoundRobin bug can also leave selection state invalid after an empty update.

Scope
- Guard ork RPC selection when the ork list is empty and return a clear 503-style error.
- Map ERR_NO_ORKS_AVAILABLE (and optionally ERR_EMPTY) to HTTP 503 in wdk-app-node/workers/lib/utils/errorsCodes.js.
- Fix RoundRobin update behavior to avoid NaN/invalid index on empty lists (wdk-app-node and wdk-ork-wrk).
- Handle ERR_TOPIC_LOOKUP_EMPTY during ork discovery/refresh: log/metric on empty and avoid overwriting with an empty list.
- Add a readiness gate so the HTTP server does not accept traffic until at least one ork is discoverable, or fail fast with a clear startup error if a timeout is reached.
- Add a small regression test for /api/v1/connect behavior when ork list is empty.

Acceptance Criteria
New wallet creation returns a clear, controlled error when no orks are available (not a generic 500).
The “no orks available” error is explicitly mapped to HTTP 503 in errorsCodes.js.
RoundRobin selection does not become invalid after empty updates.
Ork discovery emptiness is visible in logs/metrics.
A test covers the empty ork list scenario.
ERR_TOPIC_LOOKUP_EMPTY during startup/refresh is handled explicitly, and the server does not accept traffic until an ork is discoverable (or fails fast with a clear startup error on timeout).

Notes
Keep behavior safe for Autobase deployments; Mongo deployments should not regress.

## Context 

- Read task 1: _docs/tasks/notification_solution_30_dec/_task1_find_out.txt
- Read its results: _docs/tasks/notification_solution_30_dec/_task1_find_out_results.txt

## Final proposed solution for the issue:

- Read_docs/tasks/notification_solution_30_dec/proposed_solution.txt

## Notes

- If you add an encrypted device info string, it would still go in deviceId which is already accepted by the API POST /api/v1/device-ids
- The front end (mobiel app) may use 'import { getUniqueId } from 'react-native-device-info';' in getting the device info.

## Task

- Understand the APIs effected and the flow of the notification system.

- Undertake the fix for the issue in the local repositories.
    - Create a common branch name for all involved repositories.

- Read the original task located at:
  `_docs/tasks/fix_tests_for_wdk-data-shard_worker/_task.md`
  (this is **task1**).

- **task1** points to **the ticket**. Read _all_ materials referenced by the ticket.

- After performing the execution described in task1 and the ticket:

  - Produce the execution report at:
    `_docs/tasks/fix_tests_for_wdk-data-shard_worker/_report.md`
  - The results from running the tests must be written to:
    `_docs/tasks/fix_tests_for_wdk-data-shard_worker/test_logs1.log`

- Objective: refactor the tests so they:

  1. **Pass reliably**, and
  2. **Follow the guide** provided in the ticket whenever possible.

- Perform debugging and fixes as needed to meet these objectives.

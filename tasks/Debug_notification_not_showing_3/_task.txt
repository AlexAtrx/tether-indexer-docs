You had this job:

Finally, I wrote this to the team:

Hi team,

The issue spans both backend and mobile and it shows inconsistent swap notifications: duplicates in some cases, none in others.
Root causes (tech):
1. Device ID registration inconsistency:
Some users have multiple active FCM tokens → duplicate notifications. 
Others have zero tokens even after login → no notifications. 
Likely due to missing or broken FCM registration flow in Rumble v2 (device ID not re‑posted after logout/login). 
2. Backend filtering gap:
The notification service sends to all tokens tied to a user without filtering for active or latest IDs. 
No deduplication logic at dispatch level. 
3. App version divergence:
Rumble v1 triggers both local (`SWAP_STARTED`) and backend (`SWAP_COMPLETED`) notifications correctly. 
Rumble v2 may have removed or altered the local trigger and device registration logic. 
4. Production vs staging drift:
Staging logs show correct `sendUserNotification` RPC calls. 
Production logs missing `SWAP_COMPLETED` events, possibly due to expired tokens or outdated app builds. 
Actions required:
Frontend (Mobile):
Verify FCM registration flow in v2 (ensure POST /device-id fires after login). 
Ensure each device maintains exactly one active token. 
Add retry logic if FCM token generation fails. 
Backend (indexer + notification):
Add filtering to select only the latest active device ID per user. 
Log userId + deviceId on registration and notification dispatch for traceability. 
Implement deduplication and expiry cleanup for old tokens. 
QA / Product:
Test on staging with v2 build (iOS, Android). 
Compare traceIds between successful and failed cases. 
Validate both SWAP_STARTED and SWAP_COMPLETED events end‑to‑end. 
Goal: unify notification behavior across all app versions, ensure one‑to‑one mapping between device and FCM token, and confirm backend dispatch reliability before v2 launch.

I'm asked by the lead dev:

---
thanks Alex for clarifications, on BE side I agree on using latest device id only but not sure which one it would be, e.g. first/last entry in array?

regarding cleanup of old tokens not sure how we can do that and how feasible it would be, any idea?

## Task

- Go through the fodlers shared with you.
- Go through the root causes.
- Find a solution, and give me in percentage how much you think you're sure the analysis is correct.
- Give me a short answer to the lead dev questions.

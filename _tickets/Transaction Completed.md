[Notification]Phantom “Transaction Completed” Notification (No Real Transaction/Funds)

Environment: [App version: Android: v. 0.10.11 iOS: v0.10.11  Used device: Xiaomi HyperOS Poco c75 , Android version: 14 , iPhone 15 pro max, IOS version 18.6.2]
Description
User receives a push notification that a transaction was completed, but:
No funds are received
No transaction appears in Ongoing or Completed lists
User did not actually perform a transaction at that time
So the system is sending a false “completed transaction” notification.

Steps to Reproduce
I don’t know how to describe the exact steps, but I had 8 swap transactions pending — they were stuck in the ongoing state, and the amounts did not match. I received the push notification only after switching the phone out of sleep mode.

## Context

* Read the “truth” file located at `_docs/___TRUTH.md`.
* Also read the data folder `_docs/task_adding_uniqueness_check_on_addresses`.

## Task

1. Use GitHub CLI to fetch the pull request from the repository:
https://github.com/tetherto/rumble-data-shard-wrk/pull/97
   
If you cannot access the PR (e.g. code not visible or access denied), stop and inform me — we’ll address the access issue together.

2. Review the code changes in the PR **and** the existing comments on it.

   * Evaluate whether the comments align with the code logic.
   * Identify any comments that are unclear, misleading, incorrect, or outdated with respect to the code.
   * Provide concrete feedback: for each problematic comment, explain why it doesn’t make sense (or why it’s wrong) and — if possible — suggest an improved comment or alternative explanation.

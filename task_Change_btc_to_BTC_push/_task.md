[Push] Change "...btc..." to "...BTC..." in the push

## Explnation

The above is the only line in the ticket. The team shared a couple of screenshots in this folder. Check them because they show what they mean. 

By 'push', I think they mean the push notification features.

When I look at the screenshot, I see a notification in one screenshot, and a sharing pop up from the bottom in the other screenshot. In both cases 'btc' shows in small letters. I think they want it to be 'BTC' (capital). 

Your task: 
1- Double check the screenshot for assurance of what they want since I'm not sure. 
2- Search in the entire code base of Rumble for this feature and understand how it happens and explains to me briefly how it does (I mean how the push notifications happen). 
3- Fix what they need without to commit any code.

# Rumble Mongo Migration & Feature Flag

## Action Items

- Alex: ping team on Slack to get reviews for account‑oscillation fix and notification work.
- Alex: close the two urgent tickets (account oscillation & notification) today.
- Alex: create a feature‑flag for Autobase support when migrating Rumble to Mongo.
- Alex: update the webhook logging to avoid “undefined” payloads.
- Alex: share the configurable Docker network script (or lightweight local‑setup script) with the team.
- Vigan: merge Mongo‑based service discovery and remove Autobase dependency for Rumble.
- Francisco: provide clarification on the “get transfer wallet” optimization task.
- Nicholas: take on a dev‑ops task (e.g., Grafana setup, Dockerization, or Ansible script) for the dev/staging environment.
- Team: schedule a short “show‑and‑tell” session to demo environment‑setup scripts (Docker vs. custom).

## Updates

- Vigan’s Mongo discovery approved by Paolo; will replace Autobase for Rumble, improving scalability.
- Recent restart fixed a bug that caused two‑hour downtime; QA was involved.
- Alex reported undefined webhook payload logs when processing tips; plans to clean up logging.
- Alex working on account‑oscillation fix and notification bug; both addressed.
- Team member moved locations, causing local worker issues; will revert to original IP to finish PR.
- Ongoing work on removing address updates and preparing PR for Mongo vs. Autobase comparison.

## Decisions

- Keep Autobase support behind a feature flag for backward compatibility and user choice.
- Unified config (CB engine) will let users select Mongo, HyperDB, or custom implementations.
- Prefer Docker‑based environment setup for reproducibility, but also allow a lightweight script for non‑Docker users.

## Technical Discussions

- Potential empty orchestrator init array causing bad state; need guard check.
- Mongo‑based discovery expected to give better visibility into orchestrator state transitions.
- Logging improvement: avoid logging undefined webhook payloads.
- Docker network script currently single‑network; can be made configurable via command‑line flag.
- Local Ethereum node helpful for fast resets; consider integrating lightweight local blockchain in dev scripts.

## DevOps & Tooling

- Current PM2 scripts are sufficient; avoid adding Ansible/Docker layers for Rumble production now.
- Idea: one‑click script to spin up full dev environment, accept optional chain flags, gather RPC keys.
- Nicholas could work on Grafana setup or Dockerization for dev/staging; keep effort ≤ 25 % of time.
- Plan monthly “show‑and‑tell” sessions to share tooling improvements and onboard new contributors.

## Open Issues / Risks

- Need to verify guard for empty orchestrator array after Vigan’s changes.
- Ensure Autobase feature flag does not introduce regressions for existing users.
- Potential friction for developers unfamiliar with Docker; provide clear docs or alternative script.
- Limited availability today (holiday, snow) may delay some reviews.

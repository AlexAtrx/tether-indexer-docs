## Yesterday’s Recap

- Rumble v1 load tests reviewed; streamer traffic expected to go live.
- Usman reported infrastructure strain under concurrent load.
- Identified blockers: MongoDB timeout hangs, missing push‑based sync.
- Planned actions: push‑notification fix, broadcast sync POC, Grafana alerts.

## Notification & Device ID Issues

- Alex refactored notification worker after Francisco’s comments.
- Added test cases for new API stages (running locally).
- Multiple device IDs causing duplicate or missing notifications.
- Design change under review; target early‑next‑week finalization.

## Dario’s Wallet Listing Problem

- Dario sees empty array on first wallet‑list call, then one wallet on second; processor ID changes.
- Need to reproduce on staging (wallet‑8s‑4 URL).
- Potential causes: state sync lag or Autobase delay.

## WDK / Indexer Updates

- Team member (unnamed) cleaning provider‑log code across six indexer repos + base repo.
- Goal: close two remaining PRs, then shift to new tasks.

## Log Monitoring & False Positives

- Production logs and Grafana being checked manually; no Sentry yet.
- False‑positive alerts (validation errors mis‑rated as level 50) to be reduced.
- Plan: create alert cards, involve Usman for quick recognition.

## Miscellaneous

- Vegan unavailable for scaling discussion; current bottlenecks noted.
- Subash’s performance expectations mentioned.
- Gohar confirmed access to Runo API for debugging.
- Team wishes everyone a good start to the year.

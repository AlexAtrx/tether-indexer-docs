# Rumble FE&BE Team collab

## Action Items

- **Alex**: Review and approve the main PR for the wallet oscillation fix; downstream config PRs will auto‑approve.
- **Alex**: Review the notification‑duplication PR, ensure added unit tests pass, and give final sign‑off.
- **Alex**: Confirm the unique device‑ID change is merged to dev; coordinate with frontend to verify no consumer impact.
- **Alex**: Decide this week whether the provider weight logic needs a full refactor or can stay as‑is.
- **Frontend (Ashot / Afghan Dill / George)**: Test the unique device‑ID flow once the backend change lands; report any regressions.
- **Backend (Francisco / Francesca)**: Follow up on Grafana log serialization issue; provide any missing context for the team discussion.
- **Wallace team member**: Finish the pending PR for the wallets team and obtain required approvals.

## Alex’s Updates

- Finished addressing PR comments on the wallet oscillation issue; most were design questions, minor code tweaks.
- Main PR ready; config‑only PRs will auto‑approve once main merges.
- Reworked notification duplication bug (raised by Gohar); added extra unit tests, awaiting review.
- Debugged Grafana logs (shared by Francisco); traced problem to serialization rather than connection.
- Planning to focus on either closing one of the two PRs today or moving to the provider‑weight refactor discussion.

## Front‑End Team Updates

- Afghan Dill, Ashot, and George present; no major new items beyond bug fixes.
- Open PR for unique device ID integration; needs backend merge before testing.
- No additional requests for the backend at this time.

## Backend / Infra Updates

- Updated ad‑provider logging to be chain‑agnostic; required config tweaks and resolved merge conflicts (took full Friday).
- Finalizing a task for the wallets team; one more PR pending approval.
- Reviewed logs posted by Francesca; aligning on last‑Friday issues.
- Working on removing address application in RPC methods (Edo’s current focus).

## Open Issues & Follow‑Ups

- Push‑notification API change: unique device ID to be accepted; backend not merged yet.
- Provider weight logic: recent fix may have made weight obsolete; decision needed on refactor scope.
- Serialization gap identified in Grafana logs; further investigation scheduled for the week.

## General Notes

- Most of the team was on holiday; limited updates from the front‑end side.
- Team agreed to keep communication via Slack DM for any urgent items.
- Meeting wrapped up with thanks and a reminder to reach out individually if needed.

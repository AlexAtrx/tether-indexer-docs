  - Notary: \~**€2 400**; valuation: **€895** (online option €95).
  - Transfer tax: **2 %**, but only **1 %** (half) because buying jointly and wife is under 35.
- **Mortgage structure**
  - NHG possible → interest discount **0.4–0.6 %**; one‑time NHG fee **0.4 %** (\~€1 500).
  - Fixed‑rate period suggested **10 years** (options 5–20 years).
  - Early repayment without penalty allowed (full payoff possible).
- **Next steps**
  - Alex to gather and send profit‑and‑loss reports + 2025 tax filing (available after Feb).
  - Advisor (Vincent) will run final calculation and email the detailed mortgage scenario.
  - Consider engaging a local house broker for the target area (Amsterdam‑Utrecht corridor) to handle negotiations and bidding.
- **Additional considerations**
  - Wife’s future income could improve tax‑deduction of interest.
  - Pension outlook: lower state pension due to limited Dutch residency; optional private pension savings (tax‑advantaged).
  - Age not a barrier for mortgage, but banks focus on income stability and remaining working years (especially before age 57).

- Employment contract(s).
- Dismissal/termination letter (or note of missing letter).
- Pension overview (PNO).
- Vacation‑day balance sheet.
- Proof of any extra allowances (13th month, bonus, legal costs).

## Income Reporting (Inkomstenopgave)

- Fill in the **“Inkomstenopgave betalingsonmacht”** each month during the notice period.
- Report all income: hours worked for the curator, any ZZP earnings, overseas payments, etc.
- Use DigiD to log in to **Mijn UWV**; the form appears on the first day of the following month.
- Submit even if you have **no income** – otherwise you receive no payment.

## ZZP / Self‑Employment Considerations

- Being a **ZZP’er** does **not** count as a new employer; keep “Nee” for new employer question.
- Report ZZP earnings only in the monthly income statement, not in the insolvency application.

## Legal Costs Claim

- List lawyer fees under **“overige vorderingen”** with invoices attached.
- UWV may reject the claim; if so, you can later submit the same claim to the **curator**.

## Support & Assistance

- For rent or mortgage issues: request a **letter from the curator** confirming non‑payment due to bankruptcy; give it to landlord or bank.
- For severe financial hardship (e.g., unable to buy groceries): call **UWV Telefoon Werknemers 088‑898 9294** for advice and referral to local support services.

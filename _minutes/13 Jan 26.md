# Automating Deployments and Transaction Aggregation

## Action Items

- Alex → share links to the bridging PRs for dev merge.
- Tag Vegan on the PRs and confirm his availability for the required reviews.
- Follow up with Chetas today to fix the broken GitHub Actions workflow.
- Review & merge Nicolas’s provider‑logs PR and the block‑range‑sync PR.
- Continue implementing the “empty message” fallback for notifications and push the ticket to **In Progress**.
- Nicolas → finish read‑only migration of verify‑signature methods and integrate them into the indexers.
- Coordinate with Usman to document deployment steps for dev and staging (including rollback procedures).
- Schedule a short sync this week to decide ownership of the Ansible automation effort.

## Updates

- Alex completed the notification analysis, created a ticket, and will start phase 2 (empty‑message handling).
- Wallet affiliation changes approved; ready on dev, awaiting measurement.
- Production proposal‑fix issue discussed; consensus reached on handling ORC downtime.
- Balance‑oscillation bug merged; deployment can proceed.
- Nicolas added a verify‑signature endpoint; converting wallet verify functions to read‑only.

## Deployment Process

- Current flow is manual, causing context‑switching and delays.
- Nicolas built Ansible scripts for dev/staging automation; ownership open.
- Concerns: limited Ansible experience on the team, need to sync with Vegan before production rollout.
- GitHub Actions are configured but non‑functional; Chetas to be consulted.
- Idea to define a regular release window (e.g., Thursday) and aim for bi‑weekly releases to avoid large batches.

## Verify Signature Work

- Using WDK wallet verify functions; discovered they aren’t read‑only.
- Migrating these methods to read‑only across wallets, testing, then integrating into indexers.
- Goal: ensure API can confirm that a mobile‑signed address truly belongs to the user.

## Transaction Service Discussion

- Rumble app currently shows two entries per transfer (transaction + gas fee).
- Proposal: backend service aggregates on‑chain transaction + gas into a single object with total amount and fee breakdown.
- Must ensure both entries share the same hash/nonce; edge‑case handling and future migration path needed.
- Frontend can remain stateless; backend delivers the combined record.

## Merge & Permissions

- Usman has merge rights for dev and staging, not for production.
- Alex can merge PRs for dev/staging; production merges still require higher permission.

## Upcoming Reviews & PRs

- Two reviews needed for today’s dev deployment; Vegan likely the missing reviewer.
- Spark PR still pending review → will not be part of the current release.
- Bridging PRs to be linked and reviewed before deployment.

## Release Cadence

- Suggest weekly Thursday releases (dev → staging → production) or at least every two weeks.
- Define clear steps, assign a release owner, and automate as much as possible to reduce bottlenecks.

## Other Topics

- Gohar reported a balance‑oscillation issue this morning; merged and ready for deployment.
- Team discussed using Bruno to inspect API responses; Alex offered to show usage.
- Mentioned potential future move to Kubernetes‑based container deployments for long‑term scalability.

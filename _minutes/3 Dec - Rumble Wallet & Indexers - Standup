# Rumble Wallet & Indexers - Standup

## Action Items
- Finish PR for address‑uniqueness security fix  
- Complete Mongo config performance changes  
- Create PR for duplicate swap‑notification bug (analysis already shared)  
- Start decoder‑view ticket after finishing wiggle code reviews  
- Add safeguard PR to prevent duplicate transaction events  
- Implement manual retry endpoint for skipped blocks/transactions  
- Test all staging‑environment endpoints (Gohar) before production rollout  
- Follow up with Nicholas on orchestrator performance testing results  
- Schedule a debugging session for the ORC worker peer‑connection failures  
- Work with Usman on consolidating RPC‑error metrics in the base worker  
- Merge Prometheus push‑gateway and indexer‑lag metric PRs  
- Decide on Firebase auth vs Remote Config; add simple registration toggle via Firebase console  

## Metrics & Monitoring
- Added histogram and gauge visualizations for chain‑head vs. last indexed block latency  
- Prometheus push‑gateway set up; Grafana dashboards will show indexer lag and error counts  
- Plan to surface specific “failed after 3 retries” errors in Grafana  
- Discussed alerting on repeated transaction‑save failures (critical log + alert)  

## Indexer Retry Mechanism
- Push‑based flow now includes 3‑retry limit; after third failure transaction is ignored  
- Noted a staging incident where price‑fetch service (BFX) caused a third‑retry failure  
- Agreed to log such failures as errors and add alerting for potential indexer blockage  
- Pull‑based sync will run hourly to catch any missed transactions from push flow  

## Firebase Whitelisting Discussion
- Explored using Firebase Remote Config for a registration whitelist flag – rejected due to global visibility of email list  
- Consensus: keep whitelist logic server‑side; expose a verification endpoint for the app  
- Firebase Auth can provide user‑specific tokens, but still needs backend logic for whitelist checks  
- Immediate goal: simple toggle to enable/disable new registrations via Firebase console; whitelist feature is a later “luxury”  

## ORC Worker Issues
- Intermittent “peer connection failed” errors tied to HybridDB data‑hash table  
- Errors increase with multiple workers; also seeing unexpected autobase errors  
- Benchmarking script works for small loads; scaling to 100k requests reveals stability problems  
- Plan: debugging session after call; consider separating script execution from worker launch  

## Ticket Updates (Alex)
- Closed two tickets: address uniqueness bug and Mongo performance config  
- Analyzed duplicate swap‑notification issue; shared findings on Slack, PR pending  
- Next focus: decoder‑view ticket (expected larger PR, will split into subtasks)  
- Will address code reviews for wiggle before moving to new tickets  

## General Team Updates
- Usman working on a unified RPC‑error matrix for all indexers (base worker implementation)  
- Kulwinder integrating Prometheus metrics for indexer lag monitoring  
- Gohar to verify staging endpoints across mobile APIs after recent response‑code changes  
- Subash raised urgent email‑whitelist request; team agreed to postpone until a secure solution is defined  
- Jesse mentioned whitelist as a “luxury” feature, not required for immediate launch  
- Confidence expressed about iOS v2 launch, pending resolution of retry‑logic and monitoring gaps.

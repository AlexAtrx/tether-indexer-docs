# Public Indexer Release Planning

## Action Items

- Finish push‑based sync POC validation under load (5K+ wallets)
- Stabilize MongoDB timeout handling
- Implement generic metadata CRUD endpoint for Rumble (store in existing user collection unless new collection needed)
- Remove “initiate transfer” notification; close related ticket
- Fix failing unit tests for wallet reconciliation issue
- Investigate high‑priority production bug: wallet creation rejections, confirm root cause
- Continue work on new ticket while waiting for team availability (wallet affiliation & duplicate notification)
- Follow up with front‑end team on signature verification clarification thread
- Ping Matteo (PM) for roadmap input on architectural simplification

## Updates from Team

- Discussed pending public indexer release date; target ballpark in a few weeks
- Architecture simplification under review; possible GKE deployment for tether‑hosted indexer
- Rumble team handling most feature work; WDK core kept thin and modular
- Several PRs reviewed and merged; backlog shrinking but still growing
- Production logs show webhook processing missing payload info – ticket created to improve logging

## Architecture & Release Planning

- Goal: simplify shard layout before scaling to multiple chains
- Exploring Google Kubernetes Engine for indexer hosting; need DevOps support for YAML manifests and scaling
- Roadmap exercise by Subash expected in \~2 weeks with target dates for open‑source releases
- Emphasis on modular, developer‑first design to aid third‑party adoption

## Rumble‑Specific Features

- New metadata field for Rumble users (e.g., seed‑phrase storage preference)
- Feature to be implemented in Rumble side of WDK, not in core backend, to keep WDK thin
- Possible “Rumble metadata” collection or document extension; decision pending

## Notification & Metadata Endpoints

- Current endpoints: single user data model, device‑ID specific APIs
- Need generic metadata update endpoint (CRUD) accessible from wallet
- Decision: keep metadata in existing user collection unless complexity grows

## Resource & Team Coordination

- Jesse transitioning out of Tether; resource allocation currently unclear
- Backend team may get additional bandwidth once current load eases
- Multiple team members on holiday; communication gaps noted
- Suggestion: assign a single WDK engineer to bridge Rumble and open‑source sides

## Open Source vs Rumble Balance

- Concern: heavy focus on Rumble features leaving WDK “dry” for community
- Call for architectural decisions to make features reusable in open‑source kit
- Product manager Matteo to define roadmap that includes open‑source improvements

## Production Issues & Debugging

- Wallet reconciliation tests failing; priority to fix automatically
- Duplicate notification bug under review; ticket exists
- Wallet creation rejection issue traced to “five‑gen” component; suspect identified, deeper dive needed

## Miscellaneous

- Added plasma support request for Rumble v3; medium‑effort task, coordination with Dan needed
- Upcoming meeting with WDA team; potential larger project to start next week
- Team consensus: backlog is sizable and growing; need clearer architectural decision‑making process.

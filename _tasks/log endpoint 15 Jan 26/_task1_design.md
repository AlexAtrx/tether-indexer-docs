## Context

This task is about designing an impound that handles the log.

Read the ticket: \_docs/tasks/log endpoint 15 Jan 26/ticket.md

Read the description: \_docs/tasks/log endpoint 15 Jan 26/description.md

## Task

- Go through all the contexts here above.
- Particularly focus on the comment by SenorDev and the ticket.
- I believe his comment is reflected in the description but if there is any contradiction the comment has the priority.
- Your task is to design this endpoint completely. This is how you can do that.
  1. Read the Rumble repositories in the indexer system. This is because this end point is going to be used by Rumble mobile app only.
  2. I understand very much the senior developer's comment and the description.
  3. Write a comprehensive impound design and put its .md file in this directory.

## Note

- Take your time to think this very much through and if you need to plan, create a plan file. If you think you don't need prior planning, then do the design right away.

## Context

In this meeting, we discussed 'swap' issue: _docs/_minutes/2 Dec.md

The issue in short is that the app can't identify a transaction if it was a swap or not. The backend is not designed to link data together - it's a pure log. 

The above shared file has some idea of a solution in the end of it. Read it.

Another proposal by a dev (Avto) is written here _docs/tasks/swap_solution/proposal_by_avto.md.

## Task

- Read the above data to understand the problem and its proposed solutions in the meeting and in the separate file (Avto).

- Read _docs/___TRUTH.md for more context about the whole app and what it does and how. 

- Given that the whole problem is what the app (front end mobile app) needs to know if the transaction if swap or not, answer these questions:
1- Is Avto's solution good and better than the solution proposed in the end of the meeting notes? 
2- Is there a better solution?

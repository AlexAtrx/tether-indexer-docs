[Push] Notes on Transfer push notifications

Environment: iPhone 16, iOS 18.6.1

Steps to Reproduce:
Create two wallets
Log in to the wallet 1
Log in to the wallet 2
Send 3 USDT from wallet 1 to wallet 2
Check push notification on the phone with wallet 2

Actual Result: 
Incorrect wording and formatting in transfer push notifications

Expected result:
Consistent number format – All notifications should display currency amounts uniformly (e.g., 3 USDT without unnecessary decimals).
Correct grammar – Use proper English phrasing:
“Transfer initiated” → “A transfer of 3 USDT on Polygon is being processed for your wallet”
“Transfer completed” → “You’ve received 3 USDT on Polygon in your wallet”
Natural prepositions – Replace “initiated to” → “initiated for” and “completed into” → “completed to” or “received in.”
No terminal punctuation – Remove trailing periods at the end of short push messages.
Unified copy structure – Use the same style and tone for all statuses, e.g.:
Title pattern: “Transfer initiated” / “Transfer completed”
Message pattern: “A transfer of X USDT on [network] …”

Read the ticket: _docs/_tasks/6-feb-26-Notes on Transfer push notifications/ticket.txt

I was asked by the mobile app team to: "this is not a bug but an Improvment so I will move it to the improvments board for now and we'll take a look. please double check and close if not relevant."

Understand the ticket very well.
Check if this improvement does make sense or not.
Check the backend to tell me if it's doable in the backend or not.

When you reach a definitive conclusion, give me a short message to reply to the mobile team.

Fix BTC Transaction Amount Display (Change Output Issue)

SUMMARY
BTC "Sent" transactions display incorrect amounts because change outputs are shown as separate transactions. Users see multiple confusing entries instead of one clear transaction with the actual sent amount.

ROOT CAUSE
1. BTC indexer creates one transfer record per output (including change).
2. Data shard labels all transfers as "sent" if `from` matches wallet, even when `to` is also the wallet (change returning to sender)
3. No distinction between "payment to recipient" and "change back to self"

SOLUTION
PART 1: Label change outputs at indexing time (generic for all consumers)
PART 2: Filter change outputs at Rumble data shard (Rumble-specific)
PART 3: Add fee tracking fields (optional but recommended)

NOTE: to be completed after team discussion is concluded.

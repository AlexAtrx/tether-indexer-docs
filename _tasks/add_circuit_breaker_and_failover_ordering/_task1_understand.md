### Task

- At the moment, we have this task \_docs/tasks/add_circuit_breaker_and_failover_ordering/ticket.md
- Go through it (it's a single line as you see)
- Go through the code base and verify if you understand what's needed 100%. If you're in doubt, ask and stop until I answer.
- If you understand it, and know what's needed, give me a short brief explain what it is and why it's needed.

PS: the job is done coding wise.

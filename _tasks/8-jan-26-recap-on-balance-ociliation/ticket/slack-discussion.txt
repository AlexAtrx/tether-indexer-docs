Avto:

Hello team, in the past we had a problem with api/v1/wallets/balances endpoint where it was oscillating between pre-transaction and post-transaction states. I managed to catch such case again. the balance screens are taken 1 minute apart and the transaction timestamp is 19:13:38.
this happened many times in the application and stopped after about half an hour from the transaction. can this be investigated or fixed?

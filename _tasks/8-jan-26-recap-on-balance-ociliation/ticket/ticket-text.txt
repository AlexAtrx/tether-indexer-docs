## Title:
Bug: Intermittent Wallet Balance Oscillation After Transactions

## Description
Users continue to experience inconsistent responses from api/v1/wallets/balances, where the endpoint intermittently returns pre-transaction and post-transaction states. The issue was observed again: two balance snapshots taken one minute apart show oscillation, although the related transaction occurred at 19:13:38. Similar fluctuations persisted for ~30 minutes after the transaction.
A previous fix was deployed, but since the root cause couldn’t be reproduced locally at the time, the behavior appears to persist.
Scope:
Investigate underlying cause of state oscillation.
Establish a reliable method to reproduce the issue locally.
Apply a permanent fix.
Acceptance Criteria:
Identifiable root cause with reproducible scenario.
Consistent post-transaction balance state returned by the endpoint.
Tests added to prevent regression.

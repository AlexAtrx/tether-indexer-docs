## Context

1. Start with the reading Slack discussion and go through its reference to the screenshot and to the logs: \_docs/tasks/14 Jan 2026 Reduce the amount of queryTransfersByAddress/slack.txt

2. Read the ticket thoroughly and understand it. Pay attention to the comment in the end of the ticket, which is the same comment you got from Slack: \_docs/tasks/14 Jan 2026 Reduce the amount of queryTransfersByAddress/ticket.md

## To do

1. Go through the card locally and find out what needs to be done. If it is only configuration like Vigan is saying, then check exactly which configuration is referring to.

2. If it is all about configuration and it is editable here, quickly do the editing here without to commit or push any code.

3. If it is not about configuration, then Tell me exactly what it is and give me a brief, concise analysis of the issue.

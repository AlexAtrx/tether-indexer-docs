## Context

In an attempt to handle the task _docs/tasks/Duplicate_swap_notifications_observed/_task.md, we came up with a plan _docs/tasks/Duplicate_swap_notifications_observed/plan.md

These repos have changes added to them:
- rumble-ork-wrk
- rumble-data-shard-wrk
- rumble-app-node
- wdk-data-shard-wrk

Each change is added in the currently checked-out branch, which is fix/duplicate-swap-notifications. 

The changes are in the last commit in each repo.

## Task

1- Read the given task and understand it. 
2- Read the plan of execution based on which these changes were carried out.
3- Check the entire code of these repos and find out if the current changes in the last commit of each do reflect all the planned work without anything lacking. 
4- Check the code quality given that we need minimal change that covers the needed, not drastic changes, AND we need to keep the code changes within the scope of this ticket to avoid scope creep. 

## PS
- Don't make any changes to the code for now. Just analyze the code and check if it covers the planned work. 
- If you think you need to know more about the app to perform the task, refer to the truth file _docs/___TRUTH.md.

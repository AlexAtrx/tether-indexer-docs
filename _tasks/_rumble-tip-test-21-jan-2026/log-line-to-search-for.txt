This log line (from rumble-ork-wrk/workers/api.ork.wrk.js:248) shows exactly what the mobile app sent:                                                                                                              


This log line is needed from Grafana to be traced live while I'm doing a front end test: "Notification req include payload and transactionHash"

So basically it is:
Notification req include payload and transactionHash: <payload_value> - <tx_hash> - <isReceipt>                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
- If payload exists: Notification req include payload and transactionHash: eyJ... - 0xabc... - true                                                                                                                 
- If payload is missing: Notification req include payload and transactionHash: undefined - 0xabc... - true                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
This is the definitive line - it shows the raw values before the backend decides whether to create a RANT or TIP webhook.

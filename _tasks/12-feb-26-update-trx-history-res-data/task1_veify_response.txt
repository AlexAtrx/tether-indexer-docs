## Context

This is the specs of a feature that has been implemented yesterday: _tasks/11-feb-26-execute-plan-trx-history/SPEC.md

This is the implementation summary of it: _tasks/11-feb-26-execute-plan-trx-history/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md

All PRs are raised from the local branch feat/transaction-history-v2 on each repo. 

The code exists locally, so you don't have to check the PRs but the PRs are shared for reference.

## Task

1. Understand the future and implementation summary and the code implemented. 
2. I received a request from the lead developer to change the response of the APIs in a reduction way. Meaning the response data should be reduced and there shouldn't be so much data in the response on both impounds. These are the suggested responses.

On base wdk layer we can have just this:
```
{
  // ─── PRIMARY KEY ───
  "userId": "....", // duplicate data but helpful for querying
  "walletId": "052d6e5d-...",
  "transactionHash": "0xabc123...",
  "blockNumber": 12345

  // ─── TIMING ───
  "ts": 1707222200000, // block timestamp (epoch ms)
  "updatedAt": 1707222200000, // equals ts in Phase 1; differs for pending→confirmed in Phase 2
  "createdAt": 1707222300000, // when this doc was created/updated (backend-only, not in API response)

  // ─── CHAIN / NETWORK ───
  "blockchain": "ethereum", // indexed for filtering
  
  // ─── ASSET ───
  "token": "usdt", // indexed for filtering
  
  // ─── CLASSIFICATION ───
  "type": "sent", // "sent" | "received" | "swap_out" | "swap_in" — indexed
  "status": "confirmed", // Phase 1: always "confirmed"

  // ─── AMOUNT ───
  "amount": "0.0001", // human friendly amount
  "fiatAmount": "100.50", // may be null
  "fiatCcy": "usd", // may be null

  // ─── PARTICIPANTS ───
  "from": "0xabc...",
  "fromUserId": "..." // nullable
  "to": "0xdef...",
  "toUserId": "..." // nullable

  // ─── FEES ───
  "fee": "0.00123",
  "feeToken": "usdt",
  "feeLabel": "paymaster", // "gas" | "paymaster" — normalized: undefined → "gas"
}
```

and for rumble we can have these:
```
{
  "subType": "transfer", "rant", "tip",...
  "tipDirection": "sent", "received",... optional
  "rantDirection": ...,
  "channelId": // not sure if doable tbh
}
```

I want you first to answer the single question which is: that this reduction in the response really fulfill the feature of the APIs.  Be realistic, not idealistic.

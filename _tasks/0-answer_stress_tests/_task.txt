Hey guys, as I want to run stress tests against the staging environment. There are a few things important decisions that I am making that I'd like to share and get your feedback and modify my solution in case you have a better different approach that you'd recommend.


1. User authentication happens from rumble auth servers. Therefore creating test users is difficult. My solution: Enable test authentication during this period on the staging environment. In this test authentication mechanism, we'll be able to provide user id as part of the request.


2. Wallet addresses are created based on random hex strings. Therefore, there won't be many transactions for these addresses. Solution: Keep it as it is. We can define separate stress test suite for stress testing wallet addresses with many transactions.


What do you guys think?

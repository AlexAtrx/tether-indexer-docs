## Notification Issue

- Two QR tip flows: “live rant” includes payload, triggers chat webhook; “channel/user” lacks payload
- Backend receives notification for both, but chat event only fires for payload‑full QR
- Missing payload causes webhook validation to pass but skips chat notification
- Recent fix adds guard to discard null payloads early and log them for later alignment
- No Firebase/mobile push involvement – issue is in‑app chat notification path

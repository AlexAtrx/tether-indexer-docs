Read: _docs/_tasks/_extend_token_transfer_type_27-jan-2026/ticket_unified_explicit_transaction_types.md

These are the three PRs that are supposed to do the job:
https://github.com/tetherto/rumble-app-node/pull/138 
https://github.com/tetherto/rumble-ork-wrk/pull/93 
https://github.com/tetherto/rumble-data-shard-wrk/pull/161 

The PRs have comments on them. 
Look at the comments and tell me if they make sense or not. 
For each comment, tell me if I have to clarify refactor code or what. 
The unified ticket you read above is my own design decision, not the team decision. So if any of the comments is questioning the design, address it based on that.

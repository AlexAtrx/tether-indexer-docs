Hi, In V3, when we call this API to retrieve the tipJars of the a creator there are some addresses missing. Here's the exact call and response

We are missing: Polygon, Plasma, Lightning.

Can someone please explain what's the behaviour of this API? The team have no documentation and nothing to follow to set our expectations

Also, when the user scan a QR code of a live chat, What's the API that the app should call to send notification on the live chat?

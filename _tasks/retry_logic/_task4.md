This is relevant to the rest of the tasks in this folder: _docs/tasks/retry_logic

Read the summary to know what you have done so far: _docs/tasks/retry_logic/SUMMARY.md

Now I have this comment address in this PR: https://github.com/tetherto/wdk-indexer-wrk-base/pull/52

The comment say:
"
Where are we using the retry logic in the worker? AFAIU, we are simply defining this logic in config, but don't use it anywhere..
"

This is the reaper where you at the changes: wdk-indexer-wrk-base

Is the comment correct? Is he right by saying we are not expecting any trial logic?

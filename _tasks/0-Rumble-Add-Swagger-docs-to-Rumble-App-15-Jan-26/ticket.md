Rumble: Add Swagger docs to Rumble App

## Description

On WDK we have Swagger Docs:
https://wdk-api.tether.io/docs#/Token%20Transfers/get_api_v1__blockchain___token___address__token_transfers
(screenshot of the above linked page): \_docs/tasks/Rumble-Add-Swagger-docs-to-Rumble-App-15-Jan-26/Screenshot 2026-01-15 at 18.40.15.png

We should have the same on Rumble, behind a basic auth admin/password authentication (the meanning, the docs endpoint should be behind auth).

Steps to Reproduce: 
Open the app and navigate to BTC Holdings.
Send BTC to a valid address.
Observe the Ongoing transactions list.
Wait until transactions are marked Completed.
Return to BTC Holdings → Latest Transactions.

Actual Result:
Each entry shows different BTC amounts (e.g. 0.00008501 BTC, 0.00006537 BTC, 0.00012201 BTC).
The sum and breakdown are unclear and do not transparently represent the original transaction.
BTC Holdings balance changes, but cannot be clearly reconciled with listed transactions.

Expected Result:
Displayed amounts should accurately reflect:
Sent amount 
Network fee

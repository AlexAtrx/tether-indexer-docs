WDK & Rumble TX History endpoints: Show Reverted/Failed flags

Rumble V1 Request - WDK + Rumble TX History endpoints - Show Reverted/Failed flags

Show the failed/reverted transaction as failed in transaction history

This ticket needs to be refined - A developer should pick it up and make sure that for all chains we get the correct failed/reverted/errored status from the transaction via getTransaction (on evm) RPC endpoint and equivalent for the other chains. 

Please ping Francesco when the refinement has been done and let's double check and agree on the implementation - note that for Spark we may want to check with Dario or someone from the spark team.

## Context

The original task that has to do with docs for the Rumble API: _docs/tasks/Rumble-Add-Swagger-docs-to-Rumble-App-15-Jan-26

These are two PRs reused to implement the swagger on the APIs:

https://github.com/tetherto/rumble-app-node/pull/120
https://github.com/tetherto/wdk-app-node/pull/55

They have multiple comments for reviews and some refactors have been done by me and some more comments maybe are still not addressed. 

The color branches of these two PRs are already checked out here locally.

In the meeting today, we had some discussions about how Swagger is implemented on those APIs and what exactly the concerns are on the changes that I have made on these two PRs. 

This is notes about the discussion we had: _docs/tasks/_swagger-continue-21-jan-2026/meeting-notes.md

## Task

Check these two PRs which correspond to the local code in the local repos. 
Understand how SOG is implemented from the diff. 
Look into the meeting notes to understand exactly what the concern or the requirement is.
Tell me if the contents of this meeting do make sense and there is a middle ground or a solution that can be satisfactory for the developers and at the same time meet the documentation need of the APIs.
Do not add any change at the moment. Just tell me your evaluation.

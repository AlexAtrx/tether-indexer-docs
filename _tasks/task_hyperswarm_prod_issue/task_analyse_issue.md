# Task
You are an expert in handling MongoDB issues including connection, performance, pool configs, etc.
We have a production issue in MongoDB in production and you will solve it. 
The apps involved are in this project. 

## Context
Real ALL the data resulted form a short drubbing session we had. 
The data is in folder _docs/mongo_prod_issue.

## Backgrounds
Read ‘./_docs/___TRUTH.md’ for context. 
Optionally you can read all what's in ‘./_docs’ to get a good grasp of this app. 

## Do 
- Understand the issue from the meeting script, summary, and thoughts.
- Analyze server log in _docs/mongo_prod_issue/pool_destroyed_logs.log and understand the issue to the best possible way.
- See if you can figure the issue out with 100% clarity. 
- If not, as read in the meeting, we can ask a production guy run any command or perform any task for us. He's a PO who knows some coding and knows how to run command line in server.

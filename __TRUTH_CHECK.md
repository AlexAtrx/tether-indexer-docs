Think deeply about this and take all the time you need. 

## Task

- This directory is a personal docs folder for this INDEXER project.

- This directory includes the minutes of multiple meetings, multiple files about stack, multiple findings, and multiple Slack conversations, along with information about the backend architecture and stack, 

- I want you to write/update a singe file (___TRUTH.md), which contains the 'truth' from engineering perspective. The truth including:
• key architecture decisions
• key features that are offered by the indexer as part of the WDK
• key features that need to be in the WDK to be top industry standard 
• key features that can be as good add ups
• key challenges and weak points
• key security threat if any 
• key TODO if any 
• any other notes or concerns or suggestions that can help from engineering perspectives.

Things to read: 
• All the repos in this project including their README, config files, and main code modules.
• Meeting minutes in ./_minutes
• Tickets in ./_docs/_tickets (check files, folders, and subfolders).
• Slack messages in ./_docs/_slack
• Files ./_docs/APP_RELATIONS.md, ./_docs/setup.txt, ./_docs/WARP.md
• Understand the diagram ./_docs/wdk-indexer-local-diagram.mmd which doesn't include everything.

## Important: 
1- Be concise. Don't over elaborate on any part. 
2- Put all the output and findings in _docs/___TRUTH.md in a well formatted way. 
3- This task will repeat every random period depending on updates, so make sure the output is expandable/changeable. 
4- Optimize the truth file for developer reading AND for LLM as context for any project-related prompt.
